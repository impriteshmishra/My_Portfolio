            I'm <span className="font-semibold text-black">Pritesh Mishra </span>
          a  passionate and self-driven developer who graduated in 2025 with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from I.K. Gujral Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar.
            <br />
            <br />
            My schooling was completed at P.G. Senior Secondary School, Captaingunj, Kushinagar, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although my academic background is in electronics, my interest in technology led me to the world of software development. Since then, I‚Äôve been actively building full-stack web applications and delivering real-world solutions that focus on usability and impact.
            <br />
            <br />
           My journey began with a deep curiosity for how technology works, which gradually evolved through building real-world projects. From connecting external APIs to developing full-stack applications, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience across the development cycle. I enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces, diving into backend logic, and deploying stable, scalable web solutions.
